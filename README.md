## EDUCATION:
University of California, Santa Barbara Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science
Class of 2018

## WORK EXPERIENCE:
Honda Performance Development, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA
Data Analysis Engineer
January 2019 – Present

- Use Angular and Node to create Azure-hosted websites and databases to access and visualize data and prepare infrastructure for live data streaming and analysis with Databricks and Kafka.
- Collect and organize wind tunnel data and build multiple aerodynamic models per year using Python using SciKit Learn for use by aerodynamicists, to support simulations, and provide customers with event preparation.
- Develop methods to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize race data in Python using Matplotlib and Pandas to form concise and statistically supported reports after each race event, which are used in presentations to investigate competitiveness and increase understanding of performance.
- Write Python code to scrub off-car data at track tests, making information available momentarily after a run. Use statistical methods to quantify gains, resulting in significant performance increases.
- Create tools using C#/C++ and object oriented programming in order to improve workflow in an effort to streamline the process of wind tunnel testing and aerodynamic modeling.
- Initialize and maintain GitHub repositories to support the needs of multiple groups. Provide guidance on using version control, structuring code, and using Azure.
